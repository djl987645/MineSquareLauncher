      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Howdy everyone!<br />
<br />
Hope your spring is going great so far. Behind the scenes, I've been working on improving our project management (along with lots of other exciting things like a plot system, new WorldMachine terrain, and more!). To further those plans, <b>I am looking to gather some feedback, suggestions, ideas, or comments about the operation of the server.</b>  I've made a feedback form where I can solicit some of these responses and ideally influence the future of the project.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for general feedback on what you think is working for the project, what you believe isn't working, and any ideas to improve. I am open to any other thoughts from both current and former community members, outside observers and anyone else. <b>You can remain anonymous!  The form is only viewable by me, not the mods. </b> There is a username field so you can identify yourself, but only if you wish.  Alternatively, if you wish to directly DM me on Discord, please do, always down to chat! <br />
<br />
The form is here: <a href="https://forms.gle/WoBKjs5cxJ2ZjebT6" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener">https://forms.gle/WoBKjs5cxJ2ZjebT6</a> <br />
<br />
Thank you everyone, looking forward to seeing the feedback</div>]]></content:encoded>
